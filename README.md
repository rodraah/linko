# Linko

Linko is a GTK4/libadwaita tool for launching URLs with the browser of your choice. With Linko, you can quickly and easily switch between different browsers to open links, without having to worry about any complicated setup or configurations.

This app was inspired by Junction, a similar tool. In fact, if Junction did not suffer from slow performance and if it had been easier to set up, i wouldnâ€™t have created Linko.

### Tutorial

1. Set linko as default browser
2. Add browsers to the list
